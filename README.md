# UMOL-MolecularDataType
``MolecularDataType`` is a Julia package for
memory efficient storage of molecular data.
It also provides tools for retrieving 
information stored ``MolecularDataType`` objects.
The goal of this project is to provide a common
set of data types that can be used for
developing I/O packages that read/write
molecular data.
